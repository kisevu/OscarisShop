As a business owner in the e-commerce sector, I currently operate without the aid of any digital solutions,
relying on traditional methods to manage my operations. My product catalog features a diverse range of items,
each identified by a unique code and detailed description.
Customers browse through this catalog to place orders, and I collect essential information for each transaction,
including the customer's first name, last name, email, and address. For each purchase, a specific payment method is used,
and upon the successful completion of a payment, I take on the responsibility of notifying the customer via email,
confirming the success of their transaction. In the event of a failed payment, I also inform the customer accordingly.

To streamline operations, improve customer experience, and foster business growth, I am seeking to develop a dedicated application.
This app will leverage Oscar's Kitchen APIs to simplify my business processes, improve transaction handling,
and enhance the scalability of my online venture.
By integrating these powerful APIs,
I aim to create a more efficient and customer-centric platform that will drive the success of my business in the digital age.
